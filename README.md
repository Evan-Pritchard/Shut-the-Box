# Shut the Box



    In this game, there is a box that contains 9 tiles numbered 1 through 9 with all tiles in the “up” position. In each round of the game the player rolls a pair of dice, unless the sum of the numbers on the up-facing tiles totals 6 or less in which case the player rolls a single die. After rolling the dice (or die), the player chooses one, two, or three of the up-facing tiles totaling the same number as the roll of the dice to move to the “down” position. The player continues until either all the tiles are in the down position, or there is no combination of up-facing tiles that total the roll of the dice. The player’s score is the total of the up-facing tiles at the end of the game, with the goal being the lowest score possible. A perfect score is zero.

The program plays a single game, which consists of multple rounds (or rolls of the dice). With each round, display the contents of the box, roll and display the dice (or die), then prompt for three tiles to close. Game play continues in this manner until either all tiles are in the down position or the player enters three zero's for input.
